For **step 4** I input the command `ssh ndimaya@ieng6.ucsd.edu` and hit `<enter>` , this took me to the communal server while being logged into my personal account.

For **step 5** I input the command `git clone https://github.com/ndimaya/lab7` and hit `<enter>` , this command allowed me to clone the git repository for the lab onto the home directory of my account.

For **step 6** I input `bash test.sh` , this ran the test shell testing out the code to show that it fails.

For **step 7** I input `vim L` `<tab>`, `<.>`, `java`, `enter` , this tab autofills in "Lab6" and vim takes us into the file and allows me to see the actual text of the code in that file. Then I pressed `<down arrow>` 44 times, the `<left arrow>` 13 times until I was over the number 1, `r`, hitting r allowed me to replace the current number with something else, `2`, replaces the 1 with a 2,`<esc>`, takes me out of the insert mode, `<shift>`, `<:>`, `wq`, `<enter>`, which saves the changes and exits the vim.

For **step 8** I input `bash test.sh`, `<enter>` , this ran the test shell again to show that the tests pass.

For **step 9** I input `git commit L`, `<tab>`, `<enter>`, tab autofills L as Lab7 and git commit moves us to a seperate screen to finish commiting our changes to the github repository, `i`, `good job`, `<esc>`, I puts us into insert mode, good job is the message we are inputting and esc makes us leave insert mode `<shift>`, `<:>`, `wq`, this string of commands saves the changes we input to the message, `git push L`, `<tab>`, `.java`, `enter` , git push pushes the changes to the online repository and tab autofilled in Lab7.
